"""
Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite supply of
 each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins, how many ways can we make the change? 
 The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.
For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: 
{1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}. So output should be 4. For N = 10 and 
S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, there are five solutions: {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, 
{2,3,5} and {5,5}. So the output should be 5.
